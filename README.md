Ground Mounted Small Scale Solar Power Project by Vinati Organics Limited in Osmanabad, Maharashtra

Project Description

The proposed project activity of 5 MW AC (7500 kW DC) is the ground-mounted solar power plant at Dahiwadi village in Osmanabad district in the state of Maharashtra.

Project Category CoU

Applied methodologies and
standardized baselines
Applied Baseline Methodology:
AMS-I. D: “Grid connected renewable electricity
generation”, version 18

Sectoral Scope 01 Energy industries
(Renewable/Non-Renewable Sources)
____________
The proposed project activity with the title under UCR “Ground Mounted Small Scale Solar Power
Project by Vinati Organics Limited in Osmanabad, Maharashtra”, is a grid-connected renewable power
generation activity which incorporates installation and operation of solar photovoltaic power generation
project at Dahiwadi village, in Osmanabad district, in the state of Maharashtra, in India. The project has
aggregated installed capacity of 5000 kW AC (7500 kW DC). The project is an operational activity with
continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under the “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).
__________________
The project activity aims to harness Solar radiation of sun which is a renewable source, to generate
electricity. The net generated electricity from the project activity is consumed by the manufacturing
facility of the PP. The promoter of the project activity is ‘M/s Vinati Organics Limited’ (herein after
called as Project Proponent or PP). PP has the 100% ownership of the project activity. In pre-project
scenario the State utility was importing the required electricity from the NEWNE grid to meet its
requirement of electrical energy. Currently, NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers of fossil fuelbased power plants. Hence, project activity is displacing the gross electricity generation i.e., 11589.119

MWh from the NEWNE grid, which otherwise would have been imported from the grid. The project
activity doesn’t involve any GHG emission sources.
